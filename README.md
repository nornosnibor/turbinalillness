# Ronny Retro Terminal Site

A single-page, static website that looks and behaves like an old-school terminal (green on black), with a blinking block cursor, command history, and clickable links styled as terminal text.

## Features
- Authentic green-on-black terminal look
- Blinking block cursor that follows your typing
- Command history with â†‘ / â†“ arrows
- Built-in commands: `help`, `about`, `projects`, `contact`, `links`, `clear`
- Clickable "button" links in the header that run commands
- 100% static: just open `index.html`

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to test locally.
2. Deploy anywhere static (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

### Deploy to GitHub Pages (quick)
- Create a new GitHub repo, add these files, commit & push.
- In repo settings â†’ Pages â†’ set branch to `main` and root to `/`.
- Your site will be live at the URL GitHub gives you.

## Customize
- Edit text, links, or commands in `app.js` (look for the `commands` object).
- Update colors and effects in `style.css`.
